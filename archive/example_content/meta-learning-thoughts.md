Reflections on the current state and future directions of meta-learning.

## Introduction

Meta-learning, or "learning to learn," offers a promising path toward more flexible and sample-efficient AI systems.

## Current Approaches

Most meta-learning work focuses on either:
- Optimization-based methods (MAML, Reptile)
- Metric learning approaches (Prototypical Networks, Matching Networks)
- Memory-augmented architectures

## Open Questions

1. How can we scale meta-learning to complex, real-world domains?
2. What inductive biases are most useful for rapid adaptation?
3. Can meta-learning reduce reliance on large datasets?

## Conclusion

Meta-learning remains an underexplored area with significant potential for impact.
